This TYPO3 extension for lexicographic resources implements the `DMLex data
model <https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/lexidma>`__, version 1.0 WD1. It
includes the two official modules Controlled Vocabulary and Linking, as well
as a custom Editorial module and in-line annotations. In addition to the data
model, the extension also provides extensible `TEI Lex-0
<https://dariah-eric.github.io/lexicalresources/pages/TEILex0/TEILex0.html>`__
and `OntoLex Lemon <https://www.w3.org/2019/09/lexicog/>`__ serialisations
provided through a REST endpoint based on a specification from the EU-funded
Elexis project. In addition to the focus on dictionary entries, the extension
also provides encyclopedic articles and glossary entries as additional data
types.
