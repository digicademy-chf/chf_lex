This TYPO3 extension for lexicographic resources implements the
`DMLex data model <https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/lexidma>`__, version
1.0 CSD01, as part of the Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF). It includes the
two official modules Controlled Vocabulary and Linking, as well as a custom
Editorial module and in-line annotations. Other additions are intended to make
it work better for dictionaries with a historical component. In addition to the
data model itself, the extension also provides
`TEI Lex-0 <https://dariah-eric.github.io/lexicalresources/pages/TEILex0/TEILex0.html>`__
and `OntoLex Lemon <https://www.w3.org/2019/09/lexicog>`__ serialisations
designed so they can be provided through REST endpoints. In addition to
dictionary entries, the extension also allows for encyclopedic entries and
works well with CHF Gloss to further integrate glossary entries.
