Introduction

The extension allows you to build comprehensive lexicographic resources in
your TYPO3 project. This includes dictionaries with various features such as
transcriptions and complex relations, but also encyclopedia entries. The
extension is designed for a full editing workflow in the backend, but records
may also be imported instead. Based on the DMLex standard, resources built
using this tool also automatically have serialisations as TEI Lex-0 and
OntoLex Lemon, among other formats. The extension is part of the Cultural
Heritage Framework (CHF), which provides additional functionality such as
glossary entries, bibliographic references, and geodata.

..  attention::

    The extension is not final yet. A lot of things may still change over the
    coming months.
