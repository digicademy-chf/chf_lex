Introduction
============

The extension allows you to build comprehensive lexicographic resources in
your TYPO3 project. This includes dictionaries with various features such as
transcriptions and complex relations, but also encyclopedia entries and
glossary entries. The extension is designed for a full editing workflow in the
backend, but records may also be imported instead. Based on the DMLex
standard, resources built using this tool also automatically have
serialisations as TEI Lex-0 and OntoLex Lemon, among other formats.

..  attention::

    The extension does not currently include a generic frontend template. To
    use it, you may thus need (someone with) knowledge of how templating works
    in TYPO3.
